        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p style="color:black">We collect information to provide and improve our service. This includes: Personal Data you provide directly when registering (name, email), creating a profile, making purchases, or contacting us. We also collect Usage Data automatically, such as your IP address, browser type, pages visited, and time spent, using cookies and similar technologies to analyze trends and administer the site. For transactions, we collect necessary Payment Information, though complete credit card details are processed by secure third-party payment gateways, not stored on our servers.</p>

        <p style="color:black">Your information is used for several core purposes: to operate and maintain your account, allowing access to tutorials and community features; to process transactions and deliver purchased products or downloads; to communicate with you about account updates, service announcements, and promotional offers (you can opt out of marketing); and to improve our website by analyzing how users interact with our content and features, helping us develop new tutorials and a better user experience.</p>

        <p style="color:black">We value your privacy and do not sell your personal data. We may share information only in specific circumstances: with trusted third-party service providers (like hosting, analytics, and payment processors) who assist our operations under strict confidentiality agreements; if required by law to comply with legal obligations or protect rights and safety; or in connection with a business transfer, such as a merger or acquisition, where user information is among the transferred assets. User-generated content (e.g., forum posts, public profiles) is shared according to your privacy settings.</p>

        <p style="color:black">We implement commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures, such as encryption and secure servers, to protect your personal information from unauthorized access or disclosure. However, no internet transmission is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. We retain your personal data only as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this policy, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements. Usage data is typically retained for internal analysis for a shorter period.</p>

        <p style="color:black">You have certain rights regarding your data. You can access, update, or delete your account information through your profile settings or by contacting us. You can opt out of marketing communications via the "unsubscribe" link in emails. Through your browser settings, you can control cookies, though disabling them may limit some website functionality. Depending on your location (e.g., under GDPR or CCPA), you may have additional rights to data portability, restriction of processing, or objection. To exercise these rights, please contact us using the details below.</p>

        <p style="color:black">This policy applies solely to information collected by the Origami Hub website, not to third-party websites linked from our service, which have their own privacy policies. Our services are not directed to children under 13; we do not knowingly collect their data and will delete it if discovered. We may update this policy periodically, and we will notify users of material changes by posting the new policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. For any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or your data, please contact us at:</p>
