        <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>

        <p style="color:black">By using the Origami Hub website, you automatically agree to be bound by these Terms. The platform provides a service for learning and sharing origami through tutorials, patterns, a community forum, and an online shop for related products. Access to certain features requires registration, for which you must provide accurate information and be at least 13 years old, and you are responsible for securing your account.</p>

        <p style="color:black">You retain ownership of the content you submit, but by posting, you grant Origami Hub a broad license to use it on the platform. Your submissions must be respectful and cannot infringe on others' rights or contain harmful material. All other website content (designs, official patterns, code) is the intellectual property of Origami Hub and is protected by copyright; you may use it for personal, non-commercial purposes only, not for resale or redistribution.</p>

        <p style="color:black">Purchases through the site are generally final, with payments processed securely by third parties. Crucially, you must acknowledge that practicing origami involves inherent risks with tools and materials, and you assume full responsibility for your safety. The website and its content are provided "as is" without any warranties of accuracy, completeness, or uninterrupted service, and Origami Hub's liability for any issues is strictly limited.</p>

        <p style="color:black">You agree to follow community guidelines, acting respectfully and providing proper credit for shared designs. Origami Hub reserves the right to moderate, modify, or remove any user content that violates these Terms and to terminate access for users who breach them, engage in unlawful activity, or harm the service or its community, potentially without prior notice.</p>

        <p style="color:black">These Terms can be updated at any time, and your continued use signifies acceptance of the changes. They are governed by the laws of our operating jurisdiction and any disputes are to be resolved through negotiation, mediation, and finally binding arbitration, waiving the right to a class action lawsuit. The service may contain links to third-party sites for which we are not responsible.</p>

        <p style="color:black">If any part of these Terms is found invalid, the remainder stays in effect. This document represents the complete agreement between you and Origami Hub regarding your use of the service. For any questions about these Terms, to report copyright infringement, or for other concerns, you can contact us using the provided address, email, or phone number.</p>
