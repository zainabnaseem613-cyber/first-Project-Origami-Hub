    <h1>Article of Origami</h1>

    <h3>The Humble, Sacred Origins</h3>
    <p>Origami began in 6th-century Japan as a sacred Shinto ritual, not an art form. Paper was rare and pure, folded into ceremonial gifts and offerings. The core rule—transforming a single square sheet without cuts—was established, turning simple material into something sacred.</p>

    <h3>The Democratization of a Courtly Art</h3>
    <p>For centuries, origami stayed with Japanese nobles and priests. It became popular in the Edo period (1603–1868) when paper became affordable and the first known book, Sembazuru Orikata, was published in 1797. This shifted origami from secret tradition to a shared, codified practice.</p>

    <h3>The Western Cross-Pollination and Akira Yoshizawa</h1>
    <p>The 20th-century transformation of origami is credited to Akira Yoshizawa. He created the standard diagram system (dashed/dotted lines) so folds could be shared worldwide, and invented "wet-folding" to make soft, sculptural models. He turned origami into a serious global art.</p>

    <h3>The Mathematical Revolution and Computational Design</h3>
    <p>In the late 20th century, origami fused with advanced math. Scientists like Robert J. Lang used geometry and algorithms to design incredibly complex models—insects, dragons—from one uncut square. This showed origami is a precise language of engineering and design..</p>

    <h3> From Art to Applied Science</h3>
    <p>Origami principles now solve modern problems. NASA uses them for foldable space telescopes and solar panels. Medical fields apply them to stents and surgical tools. Architects design deployable shelters. The ancient fold is now key to creating efficient, transforming structures.</p>
   
    
    <blockquote>"Origami teaches us that with patience and imagination, a flat paper can become something extraordinary."</blockquote>
